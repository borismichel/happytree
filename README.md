#HappyTree

Little applet to create random fractal trees that spawn blossoms, then leaves which subsequently drop using P5.js 

To enjoy: unpack and run `/www/index.html` - all the leaves are gone? Don't worry, press F5!

You can always demo the current build at **http://myhappytree.herokuapp.com**.

I have included an express web server to serve the ..umm...website(?) on port 3320

If you want to use this as well, make sure oyu have node.js installed and follow these steps:

1) clone/download the repo
2) unpack and open the project folder in a shell
3) run `npm install`to download all dependencies (express, essentially)
4) when done, run `npm start` in the same shell
5) open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3320`
